Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel!
I'm [Your Name], and today I'm going to show you something really cool.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I built a Personal Finance Tracker app in Python,
and it's completely open source on GitHub!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you've ever wanted to track expenses, visualize spending in charts,
and manage finances all in one desktop app, this video is for you.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm a developer passionate about building practical desktop applications
and teaching others how to code.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On this channel, I share Python tutorials, full-stack projects, and open-source code.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the Personal Finance Tracker.
Built with Python 3.8, Tkinter, SQLite, Matplotlib, and tkcalendar.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The app has four main tabs:
Dashboard, Transactions, Add Transaction, and Analytics.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Dashboard: Shows total income, expenses, and net balance.
Also displays recent transactions.

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Transactions: Lists all transactions.
Filter by income or expense, and delete records if needed.

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Add Transaction: Enter new transactions with date, type, category, amount, and description.

11
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Analytics: Income vs Expense, Category Breakdown, and Monthly Trend charts.

12
00:04:30,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Everything is stored locally in SQLite.
Your data stays on your computer. No cloud, just privacy.

13
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Step one: Clone the repository from GitHub.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/finance-tracker.git

14
00:05:30,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you don't have Git installed, head to git-scm.com and install it.

15
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Navigate into the project folder:
cd finance-tracker

16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Next step: Create a Python virtual environment.
python -m venv .venv

17
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This creates a folder called .venv.
On Windows, activate it with: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

18
00:07:30,000 --> 00:08:00,000
With the virtual environment active, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

19
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This installs matplotlib, tkcalendar, Pillow, and other dependencies.

20
00:08:30,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To run the app:
python src/main.py

21
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The Personal Finance Tracker window opens!
Clean, professional, with blue and white theme.

22
00:09:30,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Here's the Dashboard with three summary cards:
Total Income, Total Expenses, Net Balance.

23
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Date range buttons: This Month, This Year, Last 30 Days.
These let you filter your summary instantly.

24
00:10:30,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's add some transactions. Switch to the Add Transaction tab.

25
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Here's the form. Pick a date, select Expense or Income,
choose a category, enter amount, add description.

26
00:11:30,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Example: Groceries expense for 1,250 rupees.
Click Add Transaction.

27
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Success! Now add an income entry: Salary, 50,000 rupees.

28
00:12:30,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Switch back to Dashboard.
Summary cards now show: Income 50,000, Expenses 1,250, Balance 48,750.

29
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Transactions tab shows all entries.
Filter by Expense, Income, or All.

30
00:13:30,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Delete Selected removes records. Confirmation dialog appears.

31
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Analytics tab: Three chart types.
Income vs Expense shows totals in bars.

32
00:14:30,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Category Breakdown shows spending by category.

33
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Monthly Trend shows income and expense over 12 months as line graph.

34
00:15:30,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Code structure: src/main.py handles GUI, src/database.py handles database operations.

35
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Key features: Add/delete transactions, filter, charts, local SQLite database, professional UI, Indian Rupee currency.

36
00:16:30,000 --> 00:17:00,000
GitHub repository is in the description. Clone, run, customize, contribute!
