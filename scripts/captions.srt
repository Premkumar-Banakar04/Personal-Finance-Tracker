Hi — I’m [Your Name]. This is a walkthrough of the Personal Finance Tracker built in Python with Tkinter and SQLite.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The app stores transactions in SQLite and has four main tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, Add Transaction, and Analytics.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now I’ll add a sample expense. Select a date, pick Type as Expense, choose a category, enter the amount, add a short description, and click Add Transaction.

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Switch to the Dashboard to view Total Income, Total Expenses, and Net Balance. Recent transactions appear below.

5
00:03:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In Transactions, you can filter by type and delete records. Select a row and click Delete Selected to remove it.

6
00:04:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Open Analytics to view Income vs Expense, Category Breakdown, and Monthly Trend charts. Axis labels and values use Indian Rupees.

7
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Quick code pointers: `src/database.py` has the schema and CRUD operations; `src/main.py` contains the UI and chart code.

8
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thanks for watching. I can also generate captions, a slide deck or help with recording/editing if you'd like.
