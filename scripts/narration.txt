Personal Finance Tracker — Demo Narration Script

Total target length: 6–8 minutes. Read at a steady pace.

0:00 - 0:20 — Intro
Hi — I’m [Your Name]. This is a walkthrough of the Personal Finance Tracker built in Python with Tkinter and SQLite. In about six minutes I’ll show core functionality: adding transactions, viewing dashboard summaries, filtering transactions, and analytics charts. Let’s get started.

0:20 - 1:10 — Project overview
The project uses a small MVC-style structure. The UI is in `src/main.py`, and the database layer is in `src/database.py`. It uses `tkcalendar` for date picking and `matplotlib` for charts. I’ll briefly show the project folder in VS Code, then move to the app.

1:10 - 2:30 — Add Transaction demo
I’ll add a sample expense and income so you can see how everything updates. Switch to Add Transaction. Pick a date, choose Type Expense, select a Category, enter Amount, add a short Description, and click Add Transaction. The app validates input and stores the entry in the local SQLite database. Now add an Income entry — Salary — and click Add again.

2:30 - 3:20 — Dashboard and Recent Transactions
Switch to the Dashboard tab. Here we see three summary cards: Total Income, Total Expenses, and Net Balance, all displayed with Indian Rupees. The recent transactions tree lists the latest entries — notice the new records we added. The dashboard uses the date range; I can change the range using the preset buttons.

3:20 - 4:20 — Transactions Tab (filter & delete)
Open the Transactions tab — it lists all transactions. Use the Filter dropdown to show only Expenses or only Income. Select a row and click Delete Selected to remove it — there is a confirmation dialog. If you make a mistake you can re-add transactions via the Add tab.

4:20 - 5:20 — Analytics and Charts
In the Analytics tab we have three chart buttons: Income vs Expense, Category Breakdown, and Monthly Trend. Click each to render the matplotlib charts. The charts display axis labels in rupees and values on the bars. These visuals help spot trends at a glance.

5:20 - 5:50 — Code pointers
Quickly show `src/database.py` — where tables are created and CRUD functions live. Then open `src/main.py` to show where UI layout, styles, and chart generation are implemented. If you want to change currency, date format, or categories, these files are the places to update.

5:50 - 6:10 — Closing
Thanks for watching. If you’d like, I can provide captions, a timed SRT file, or help with editing and adding an intro slide. Let me know what you want next.

Notes for recording:
- Read naturally; pause briefly between sections.
- Use screen/window capture and include small webcam overlay if desired.
- Keep terminal/notifications muted.
